  <h1>Vacuum Tubes<h1/>
  <p>Alternatively called electron tubes, or valves, they were first developed in 1904 by John Ambrose Fleming. 
  The vacuum tube is a glass tube that has its gas removed, creating a vacuum.  Vacuum tubes contain electrodes for controlling electron 
  flow and were used in early computers as a switch or an amplifier. Vacuum tubes used with different devices. 
  Vacuum tubes were also used in radios, televisions, radar equipment, and telephone systems during the first half of the 1900s.
  In the 1950s, the transistor started to replace the vacuum tube. Today, vacuum tubes are no longer used in electronic equipment.
